<h2 class="section print-only"><i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i> Hi!</h2>
I'm a DevOps and full stack software engineer based in beautiful and sunny València. I made a career turn some years ago and learnt to program in React but soon enough I found myself digging deeper. These days I pretty much enjoy Python, Go, TypeScript... you name it. I am also familiar with Java's <del>verbosity</del> performance and usefulness.

Big DevOps fan, I enjoy working with containers, Terraform -- or IaC more precisely -- and I'm crazy about the great and mighty world of cryptography. In a nutshell, I love computers and they sometimes reciprocate.

<h2 class="section"><i class="fa-solid fa-briefcase"></i> I'm now working as a</h2>
_July, 2024 -- This very morning_\\
**DevOps Engineer at [Alten](https://alten.es)**, which entails development and maintenance of a datalake platform built upon AWS Glue, Lambdas, CloudFormation, and so on and so forth, big castle really, trust me ;). My job there includes full stack development, mostly in Python and Angular, client support and product optimisation.

<h2 class="section"><i class="fa-solid fa-backward"></i> Before that, I was</h2>
_June, 2021 -- January, 2023_\\
**Systems Lead at [Eventscase](https://eventscase.com)**, where I terraformed, or ansibled every AWS service in use. Before that, I contributed to the containerization of the product. And setting up dev and testing envs. And then there's the whole daily maintenance and management...

_July, 2019 -- May, 2021_\\
**Software Developer at [GFT](https://gft.com)**, as a junior, but I made my very best with Angular, then React, then eventually started leaning towards ops stuff: pipeline management, containers, scripting, managing Java microservices in OpenShift. Good ol' times, they promoted me.

<h2 class="section"><i class="fa-solid fa-graduation-cap"></i> My education includes</h2>
_November, 2018 -- June, 2019_\\
**attending Run '18 at [Devscola](https://devscola.org)**, a full stack 6-month bootcamp designed collectively by a community of active devs with a special focus on best practices. We covered TDD, XP, SOLID principles, and all agile stuff, both theoretically and in practice. We built project [Rekaizen](https://devscola.gitlab.io/rekaizen/app) and had fun while doing so.

_October, 2014_\\
**getting a Certificato di Lingua Italiana (C1)** from Università di Perugia.

_February, 2013_\\
**and a Certificate of Proficiency in English (C2)** from University of Cambridge.

_September, 2009 -- June, 2010_\\
**going off the hook, like every other Erasmus student in Bologna**, Italy... well, you know, I also toured much of the country.

_September, 2006 -- June, 2012_\\
**studying Journalism at Universitat de València**, which is not very relevant for an IT resume but quite original for a contrast, isn't it? Actually, I'm kinda proud of it, I wouldn't change it for a moment and it's unlocked me the power of creative writing to, humm just write this, hope it's enough.

<h2 class="section"><i class="fa-solid fa-star-of-life"></i> And I've also</h2>
_June, 2021 -- January, 2023_\\
**started and closed my own company, named Cloudfights**, for side projects and with the aim to explore the corporate way of life together with some colleagues. It's always nice to give a try to your little inner tycoon, but in the end you might want to code instead of... do bureaucracy.

_May, 2018 -- May, 2019_\\
**worked for a year as an International Trade consultant in Milan**, Italy. Yeah, not the kind of IT you were expecting, but I'm sure you didn't see that coming.

<h2 class="section"><i class="fa-solid fa-signs-post"></i> Lastly, when offscreen I'm</h2>
- an unguilty language lover and learner
- a wannabe group traveller with no group to travel with
- unsuccessfully trying to learn to play the guitar
- a decade-old terrible FIFA game player
- reading, reading, reading
- probably hanging out with my friends <del>at a bar</del> somewhere
